</h2>

<div>
<div>
Mount Bond (4,698 ft.), the highest peak in the southern Twin range, represents, with neighboring Mt. Guyot, one of the two most remote peaks in the White Mountains. From Bond's summit, there is virtually no sign of human impact in the form of roads or buildings.

  Suggested Routes
</h2>
</div>

<div class="p1">
<p>
  <em>Strenuous</em>: Due to its distance from the road, Mt. Bond represents a 10+ mile (one-way) trek if considered as a day trip. The best approach for this trip would be to take the Lincoln Woods Trail 2.9 miles to the Bondcliff Trail; from that junction, Mt. Bond's summit is a 7.4 mile trip. The Bondcliff Trail joins the Twinway at Mt. Guyot's summit, a good route if hikers wish to make this a multi-day excursion. Views from the exposed Bondcliff Trail represent some of the very best in the Whites.

<div class="p2">
<p>The AMC recommends all hikers check weather conditions in advance, carry a current map and guidebook, along with a compass and knowledge of how to use it. For recommendations on how to plan a safe hike in the White Mountains, see: <em>The 10 essentials for a safe and pleasant hike.</em>

  Winter Hiking on Mt. Bond
</h2>
</div>

<div class="p2">
<p>
  Winter hiking anywhere in the White Mountains requires specialized equipment and skills, and experience in coping with weather, navigation, and winter gear. Extremely severe storms can develop suddenly and unexpectedly, especially above treeline. The combination of high wind and low temperatures has such a cooling effect that the worst conditions on Mt. Bond are approximately equal to the worst reported from Antarctica, despite the much greater cold in the latter region. Hikers interested in extending their activities into winter are strongly advised to seek out organized trips with leaders who have extensive winter experience. Several AMC chapters offer winter hiking and backpacking instruction, and AMC offers several guided winter mountaineering trips; search for "Instruction" in AMC's activity listings. Helpful information can also be found in the AMC Guide to Winter Hiking and Camping .

<p> Climbing a Mountain.
There are many life lessons to be learned by climbing a mountain. From the moment, you wake up you should already be prepared to summit. Being prepared beforehand ensures that you have the correct and necessary equipment to achieve your goal. Once you arrive to the mountain it is best to try and clear your mind of any unscrupulous thought, they inhibit your true potential to experience the amazing goal you have set for yourself that day. In starting a hike, you must accept the physical as well as mental obstacles you have set for yourself, it will not be easy. But that isn’t why you are there. When hiking any mountain, there comes a point where fatigue will lead you to believe that you are closer than you actually are. You should never assume you are at the top until you reach the top. It may lead you to tire yourself out give up pre-maturely. Keeping a good pace that challenges you physically as well as being beneficial to your thinking. a dense forest secluded from man-made construct is an ideal place to reflect on one’s aspirations and goals. When summiting a peak a wave of accomplishment paired with a vast view that not many have the pleasure of seeing.
Personally, my favorite part of the summit is a simple P.B and J can turn into a gourmet meal, nothing taste as good as it does on top of a mountain. Hiking down Is the next part of the process. Although the initial goal of summiting the peak has been completed and the vast expanse has been thoroughly taken in, the hiker has to then hike back down the mountain. It is a common reaction to want to rush down the trail and get back to civilization, but running down trail can be extremely dangerous and could potentially render your incapable of further hiking. Walking back down the trail is not as easy as it sounds quite often, keeping yourself from gaining too much momentum and falling head first can become quite difficult when carrying a heavy pack down a steep rocky trail. That is why it is best to always pick good footing and not step haphazardly down the declining trail. Once you get to the bottom you should feel a complete sense of accomplishment, as you can officially add the mountain to your list peaks bagged.
	Overall the lesson learned from hiking is that you can’t expect to achieve your goal if you don’t prepare yourself to do so, and once you’ve set out to achieve your goal you should not rush into it and fall short, a hard-constant effort, that is also focused is essential to achieving your goal. And lastly once your goal is completed it is not wise to lose focus directly after, there are always more things you need to anticipate that could throw you off and potentially effect later goal achievements.
